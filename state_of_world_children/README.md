## Child mortality rates
The dataset is created from data provided by UNICEF’s State of the World’s Children 2013 report:
http://www.unicef.org/sowc2013/statistics.html

Child mortality rates (number of children who die before age 5, per 1000 live births) for 195 countries, and a set of other indicators are included.

#### Investigation
1. Which country had the highest child mortality rate in 1990? What was the rate?
2. Which country had the highest child mortality rate in 2011? What was the rate?
3. Some countries are missing some features (see original .xlsx/.csv spreadsheet). How is this handled in the function assignment1.load unicef data()?
